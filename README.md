# LIDAR-Camera-Object-Detection.
LIDAR and Camera Object Detection is a project on which i integrated electronics and machine learning algorithms..This project uses LIDAR to measure accurate distance using TOF or time of flight algorithm of an object in front of it. We also use a camera to detect the object using TensorFlow machine learning algorithm. The LIDAR and camera is therefore integrated on a single package using raspberry PI. The LIDAR and camera is attached to a servo that continuously sweeps 180 degrees several times per second. This project is intended to be applied on applications such as autonomous driving ,military applications, robots etc. for the ahead lying  robotics era.
